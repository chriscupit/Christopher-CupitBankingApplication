# BadBank Project

This is the Bad Bank exercise for MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN course. This is a simple application that allows a user to create an account and do deposits and withdrawals with limited security.  

Instructions on how to run and use the program will be updated once the project is complete.

The application has a landing page, create account page, deposit page, withdraw page, login page and all data page.  A user can 
create an account as well as deposit and withdraw money.  A backend database is used to store user data and is called by the front end when requested through the create account page or login page.  I plan on improving on the functionality and security soon.
